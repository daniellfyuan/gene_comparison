# gene_comparison
Comparing genbank genes with that from Glimmer3 (gene prediction software) for E. coli acession AB011549.2

This project directory has a directory called "Template", which is where genecomp.html is stored. The CGI file "gene_predict_comp.cgi" is found outside of the Template directory. The genbank file "AB011549_2.gb" is extracted from NCBI and is located where the CGI file is. The Glimmer3 result "run1.detail" is also with the CGI and genbank files.
